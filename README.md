# Description

This browser application allows users to enter and save text to create events for each hour of the day.

At the top of the page is a short description of the application's utility. Below the description is a digital clock that moves forward for every second.

Below, in the schedule area, users first see column headers indicating the purpose of each field. Users can enter text for each hour of the day and save that text to view it later. When users click the save icon, text will appear indicating the the text has been saved to that hour block.

Over the course of the day, the color coding of the schedule will change. If the hour block on the schedule is in the past, it will appear in gray. If the hour block is the current hour, it will appear in red. If the hour blcok is in the future, it will appear in green.
